# MPSTools

This is a C++ library for ground state optimization (DMRG), real time evolution (TEBD) and calculation of spectral functions (Chebyshev and TEBD) of extended 1d strongly interacting quantum lattice systems. 

The code uses an MPO formalism to facilitate implementation of new models.

Dependencies:
boost, blas, lapack
